    <p>Your solution for different contention.</p>
    <p id="information">And all I am is a man
      I want the world in my hands
      I hate the beach
      But I stand in California with my toes in the sand
      Use the sleeves of my sweater
      Let's have an adventure
      Head in the clouds but my gravity centered
      Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
      You in those little high waisted shorts, oh
      Oh, she knows what I think about
      And what I think about
      One love, two mouths
      One love, one house
      No shirt, no blouse
      Just us, you find out
      Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no
      'Cause it's too cold
      For you here
      And now, so let me hold
      Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
      And if I may just take your breath away
      I don't mind if there's not much to say
      Sometimes the silence guides a mind
      To move to a place so far away
      The goosebumps start to raise
      The minute that my left hand meets your waist
      And then I watch your face
      Put my finger on your tongue 'cause you love to taste, yeah
      These hearts adore, everyone the other beats hardest for
      Inside this place is warm
      Outside it starts to pour</p>
